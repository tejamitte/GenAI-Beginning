## 1. Fault tolerance is:

1) ability of a system to continue operating without interruption and performance degradation when one or more of its components fail
2) ability of a system to continue operating without interruption but with minor performance degradation when one or more of its components fail
3) ability of a system to continue operating after a small interval of out of service when one or more of its components fail
4) ability of a system to continue operating after restarting when one or more of its components fail:

## 2. Circuit Breaker Design pattern have three states: [Select THREE]

1) Closed
2) Open
3) Pending
4) Half-Open

## 3. ___ provides an alternative result for failures: [Choose ONE best answer]

1) Retry
2) Fallback
3) Cache
4) Bulkhead

## 4. What resilience pattern is described as: “beyond a certain wait interval, a successful result is unlikely”

1) Retry
2) Rate Limiter
3) Time Limiter
4) Fallback

## 5. How Circuit Breakers in Half-Open state work:

1) Circuit Breakers start transitioning to Closed state
2) Circuit Breakers make a trial call to the supplier microservice periodically to check if it has recovered
3) Circuit Breakers make a trial call to the client periodically to check if it’s available
4) There is no such state in Circuit Breaker
