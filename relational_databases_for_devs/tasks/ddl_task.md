## DDL-Task

----

please, read the application requirements and **create the database schema(with corresponding ddl sql scrips)** needed
for
implementation of listed endpoints.

#### part I

imagine you want to create a simplified version of  [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/) platform where users can see the
reviews and ratings of different movies, registered users can add their own reviews to movies. You have to provide
following API endpoints

1. you have to be able to retrieve movie list according to different genres sorted according to rating
2. you have to be able to retrieve reviews of specific movie sorted by date
3. you have to be able to leave movie review as a user
4. you have to be able to rate a movie from 1 to 10

#### part II

after you created ddl scrips which meet the above listed requirements let's imagine that we need to improve our app by
adding some new features. In particular, we want to add likes to user reviews and create following endpoints using it

1. you have to be able to like and unlike(if already liked) a review of a user
2. you have to be able to retrieve reviews of movie sorted by popularity i.e. likes count

**p.s please be aware that you do not actually need to implement these endpoints you just need to create database
schema (and then change it) that would make it possible to
implement these endpoints**
