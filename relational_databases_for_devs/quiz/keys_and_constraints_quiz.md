# Questions Keys & Constraints 
## 1. What is a Primary Key in SQL?
   1.  A key that can be duplicated within a table
   2.  A key that is used to link two tables together
   3.  A key that has no significance in the database
    4.  A unique identifier for each record in a table


## 2. What is a Foreign Key in SQL?
   1.  A key that is used to link two tables together
   2.  A unique identifier for each record in a table
   3.  A key that can be duplicated within a table
    4.  A key that has no significance in the database


## 3. What is a Composite Key in SQL?
   1.  A key that is used to link two tables together
   2.  A key that can be duplicated within a table
   3.  A key made up of multiple columns in a table
    4.  A key that has no significance in the database


## 4. Can a table have multiple Primary Keys?
   1.  Yes, a table can have multiple Primary Keys
   2.  No, a table can only have one Primary Key
   3.  It depends on the database management system being used
    4.  None of the above


## 5. Primary Key column can contain NULL values in SQL:
   1.  TRUE
   2.  FALSE


## 6. Can a Primary Key be made up of multiple columns in a table?
   1.  Yes, a Primary Key can be made up of multiple columns
   2.  No, a Primary Key can only consist of a single column
   3.  It depends on the database management system being used
    4.  None of the above


## 7. Can a Foreign Key reference a Non-Primary Key in another table?
   1.  Yes, a Foreign Key can reference a Non-Primary Key in another table
   2.  No, a Foreign Key must always reference a Primary Key in another table
   3.  It depends on the database management system being used
    4.  None of the above


## 8. Can a table have multiple Foreign Keys referencing the same Primary Key in another table?
   1.  Yes, a table can have multiple Foreign Keys referencing the same Primary Key in another table
   2.  No, a table can only have one Foreign Key referencing the same Primary Key in another table
   3.  It depends on the database management system being used
    4.  None of the above


## 9. What is the purpose of Constraints in SQL?
   1.  To enforce data integrity and accuracy within the database
   2.  To improve database performance
   3.  To provide security for the database
    4.  None of the above


## 10. What is a Unique Constraint in SQL?
   1.  A constraint that ensures the values in a column or combination of columns are ordered
   2.  A constraint that ensures the values in a column or combination of columns are the same
   3.  A constraint that ensures the values in a column or combination of columns are unique
    4.  None of the above


## 11. What is a Default Constraint in SQL?
   1.  A constraint that sets a default value for a column when no value is specified
   2.  A constraint that ensures the values in a column are the same
   3.  A constraint that ensures the values in a column are unique
    4.  None of the above


## 12. What is a Check Constraint in SQL?
   1.  A constraint that sets a default value for a column when no value is specified
   2.  A constraint that ensures the values in a column meet a specified condition
   3.  A constraint that ensures the values in a column are unique
    4.  None of the above


## 13. What happens when a Constraint is violated in SQL?
   1.  The database will stop executing the query
   2.  The database will ignore the constraint and continue executing the query
   3.  The database will raise an error and roll back the transaction
    4.  None of the above


## 14. What is the importance of uniqueness in Primary Keys?
   1.  To provide security for the database
   2.  To ensure that every row in the table has the same value in this column
   3.  To improve database performance
    4.  To ensure that no other row in the table has the same value in this column


## 15. What is the best practice for composite Primary Keys in SQL?
   1.  No column or smaller combination of columns should uniquely identify each row in the table
   2.  Every column or smaller combination of columns should uniquely identify each row in the table
   3.  To use a simple integer value as the Primary Key
    4.  To use no Primary Key
