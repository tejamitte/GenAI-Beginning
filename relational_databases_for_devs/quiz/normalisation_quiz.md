# Questions Normalization
## 1. What is normalization in database design?
 1.  The process of backup data in a database
 2.  The process of making sure data is consistent across multiple databases
 3.  The process of encrypting data in a database

## 2. What is the purpose of normalization?
 1.  To eliminate redundancy and improve data consistency
 2.  To make data easier to query and update
 3.  To improve performance in a database
 4.  To make data secure in a database


## 3. What are the most commonly used normalization forms?

## 6. What is the purpose of third normal form (3NF)?
 1.  To eliminate transitive dependencies in a database
 2.  To eliminate redundancy in a database
 3.  To eliminate partial dependencies in a database

## 7. What is denormalization in database design?
 1.  The process of backup up data in a database
 2.  The process of making sure data is consistent across multiple databases
 3.  The process of encrypting data in a database
 4.  The process of adding precomputed redundant data to an otherwise normalized relational database to improve read performance of the database


## 8. What is a partial dependency?
 1.  A dependency between a foreign key and a non-key attribute
 2.  A dependency between two non-key attributes
 3.  A dependency between a primary key and a non-key attribute

## 9. What is a transitive dependency?
 1.  A dependency between a primary key and a non-key attribute
 2.  A dependency between two non-key attributes
 3.  A dependency between a foreign key and a non-key attribute
 4.  A dependency between a non-key attribute and another non-key attribute, through a key attribute


## 10. What is a repeating group in a database?
 1.  A group of attributes that repeat in a database table
 2.  A group of tables that repeat in a database
 3.  A group of keys that repeat in a database table
 4.  A group of values that repeat in a database table
