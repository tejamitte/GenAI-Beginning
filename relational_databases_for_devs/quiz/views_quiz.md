  3.  A way to compress the data stored in the table
  4.  A way to control the access to the data stored in the table

  1.  A virtual table based on the result of a SELECT statement
  2.  A pre-calculated and stored physical table

  4.  A tool to execute DDL statements

## 3. Which of the following is an advantage of using views?

  3.  Providing a consistent interface to access the data in the underlying tables
  4.  Adding another level of abstraction to the database schema

## 4. Which of the following is a disadvantage of using views?
  1.  Increased query performance
  2.  Providing a consistent interface to access the data in the underlying tables
  3.  Additional overhead to maintain the view when the underlying tables are modified
  4.  Simplifying the structure of the underlying tables by only exposing the columns and rows that are needed for a specific purpose

## 5. How is a materialized view different from a regular view?
  1.  A materialized view is a physical table while a regular view is a virtual table
  2.  A materialized view is faster to query than a regular view
  3.  A materialized view cannot be modified after it is created while a regular view can be modified
  4.  A materialized view is more complex to use than a regular view
