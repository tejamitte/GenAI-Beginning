# Questions

## 1. What is Helm in Kubernetes?
1) A Kubernetes object used to define the networking configuration for a pod
2) A YAML file used to create a Kubernetes deployment
3) A package manager for Kubernetes applications
4) A type of Kubernetes probe used for checking application health

## 2. What are some benefits of using Helm in Kubernetes?
1) Simplifies application deployment and management
2) Enables version control and rollbacks
3) Facilitates collaboration and sharing of application templates
4) All of the above

## 3. What is a Helm chart in Kubernetes?
1) A YAML file used to create a Kubernetes deployment
2) A package containing all the resources necessary to create a Kubernetes application
3) A type of Kubernetes object used to define the networking configuration for a pod
4) A type of Kubernetes probe used for checking application health

## 4. How do you install a Helm chart in Kubernetes?
1) Using the kubectl CLI to create the necessary Kubernetes objects
2) Running the helm install command with the chart and configuration values
3) Editing the YAML file of the chart and applying it using kubectl
4) Using the Kubernetes Dashboard to upload and install the chart

## 5. What is a values.yaml file in a Helm chart?
1) A YAML file used to create a Kubernetes deployment
2) A file containing configuration values for a Helm chart
3) A type of Kubernetes object used to manage external access to a cluster
4) A type of Kubernetes probe used for checking application health

## 6. What is the difference between a Helm chart and a Kubernetes YAML file?
1) A Helm chart is used for deploying applications, while a Kubernetes YAML file is used for configuring the cluster
2) A Helm chart is a package manager for Kubernetes resources, while a Kubernetes YAML file describes the desired state of a resource
3) A Helm chart is a YAML file that includes additional templates and metadata, while a Kubernetes YAML file only describes the resource's properties
4) A Helm chart is used for managing cluster resources, while a Kubernetes YAML file is used for managing container images

## 7. What is the purpose of the "Chart.yaml" file in a Helm Chart?
1) It defines the metadata for the Chart
2) It defines the Kubernetes resources for the Chart
3) It defines the default values for the Chart's parameters
4) It defines the dependencies for the Chart

## 8. What is the difference between a Chart and a Release in Helm?
1) A Chart is the package for a Kubernetes application, while a Release is an instance of that application deployed on a cluster
2) A Chart is a version control system for Kubernetes applications, while a Release is a containerized application
3) A Chart is a deployment tool for Kubernetes clusters, while a Release is a monitoring tool for Kubernetes resources
4) A Chart is a Kubernetes resource, while a Release is a Kubernetes node

## 9. What is a "dry run" in Helm and why is it useful?
1) It simulates a Helm Chart installation without actually deploying the application, which can help detect potential issues before deployment
2) It monitors the Helm deployment and provides real-time metrics and alerts
3) It performs a health check on the Helm deployment to ensure it is running properly
4) It deletes the Helm deployment and all associated resources

## 10. What is the purpose of the "templates" directory in a Helm Chart?
1) It contains the default values for the Chart's parameters
2) It contains the manifest file for the Chart's Kubernetes resources
3) It contains the source code for the Chart's containerized application
4) It contains the template files for the Chart's Kubernetes resources
